The first is designated as \"True\" in order to set up a steady-state solution for our aquifer to use as a base for future transient stress periods. (If we just start solving transient stress periods with arbitrary starting heads, it wouldn't make for a very realistic natural groundwater system.) More stress periods are added to a simulation if there are changes to the \"stress\" on the aquifer, i.e. pumping, river levels, or recharge rates.

    "<strong> Note: </strong> Flopy takes cell indexing where the top left of the grid is the (0,0) cell index while the Length & Width units start at 0 in the lower left of the grid. This seems a little wierd, but it makes it easy to match up an array of cell by cell numbers to their respective locations on the grid when assigning properties or observing output data. Flopy's plotting capabilities automatically flip the resultant head data to display on its proper grid, however, for the 3d plots below, you'll see the function np.flipud() is used to flip the data array to plot in the same direction."
